# The Movie Database API - Android Application

In this android application I have used [The Movie Database(TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API.
Using this API the application shows the information of latest Movies, TV Shows & Actors. 
The primary focus behind this project is to demonstrate the integration of [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API & the techniques that I have used for this android application development which are listed below.

`Retrofit`

`MVVM - Clean Architecture Pattern`

`SQLite - Room Database`

`Dagger`

`LiveData`
